* Neovim
** TODO integrating ~direnv~ and ~coc.vim~
After attempting to use neovim's direnv plugin with ~coc.vim~ to use ~ghcide~
with a haskell project, it seems that ~coc~ starts too quickly -- i.e., before
direnv has had a chance to set the right variables. One easy fix is to run
~:CocRestart~ from inside neovim, although it would be more satisfactory to come
up with a longer term solution.
