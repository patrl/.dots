Dotfiles, primarily for NixOS, managed via ~stow~. My emacs config lives in [[http://github.com/patrl/.doom.d.git][a separate repo]].

* wm

** key chords

- ~⌘ + ⏎~ :: terminal
- ~⌘ + e~ :: emacs
- ~⌘ + ⇧ + e~ :: emacs
- ~⌘ + ␣~ :: launcher
- ~⌘ + v~ :: neovim

** bspwm

- [[file:wm/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc][My bspwm config]].
- [[file:wm/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc][My sxhkd config]]. Features tight integration with emacs.


* System

Symlink ~system/configuration.nix~ to ~/etc/nixos/configuration.nix~. Currently
rolling 18.09.

* Shell

Run ~stow -R shell~ to install dots for both ~zsh~ (my main shell), and ~fish~
(for when I feel like messing around).

** ~zsh~

Some features:

 - Plugins are managed via [[https://github.com/zdharma/zplugin.git][zplugin]].
 - Fuzzy-finding via [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git][fzf]].
 - Common unix utilities are aliased to faster rust-based alternatives:
   - [[https://github.com/ogham/exa.git][exa]] instead of ~ls~.
   - [[https://github.com/sharkdp/bat.git][bat]] instead of ~cat~.
   - [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep.git][ripgrep]] instead of ~grep~.
   - [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd.git][fd]] instead of ~fd~.

** irc

I use ~weechat~ as my irc client.

- [[file:weechat/.weechat/weechat.conf][~weechat.conf~]] contains a beautified weechat config. Ugly ASCII is replaced by unicode.
- [[file:weechat/.weechat/irc.conf][~irc.conf~]] contains my (probably less useful) irc settings.
